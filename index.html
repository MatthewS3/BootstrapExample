            The Play Station 5 has been a revolutionary piece of tech in the divided world of consoles. Play station knew they had to up their game as the announcment of the Xbox Series X had just been released and everybody was shocked at the crazy fridge like design. What no body thought was that Play Station was going to absolutely shock the world with the new very large but creative but also innovative design of the Play Station 5.

            Yes you might say that with all the technological advancements we have had we'd expect the sizes of consoles to shrink in size but that was the complete opposite to what had happened. We saw both Xbox and Play Station reach peak performance in the consoles capabilities, but that had to come as the cost of the consoles to being alarmingly large especially the PS5 which we've all come to love in the end.

            With more powerful hardware, a better design, a more comprehensive game subscription service and a delightful controller, the Xbox Series X has the current lead in the next generation of consoles. But you could make the exeption that the PS5 has might have a better and more polished 8k ray tracing for enhanced gaming if that is what you look for in a console.
